SmartDeviceLink iOS Proxy

We're still working on creating documentation for each of these individual repositories, but in the meantime, you can find more information about SmartDeviceLink [on the SDL Core README](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_core/blob/master/README.md) and [on Genivi](http://projects.genivi.org/smartdevicelink/about).
